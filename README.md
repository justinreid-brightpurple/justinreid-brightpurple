Bright Purple are a specialist technology recruitment agency based in the heart of Edinburgh. Since 1995 we have been partnering with innovative clients to place thousands of permanent and contract candidates in Technology, IT and Business Change roles.
 
Our Purple People have decades of experience between them; we use our industry contacts, insight and know-how to provide you with the expert service and advice that you need to make the best decisions for your career goals or hiring needs. We believe in making every interaction 
meaningful, and it is this approach that has seen candidates recommend us and clients returning to us again and again. 
 
There's a reason we've been around for 27 years!
